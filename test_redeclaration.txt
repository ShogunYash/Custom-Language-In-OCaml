// Test file to demonstrate variable re-declaration prevention

// First declaration - valid
let x := 10;
Print("First declaration of x:");
Print(x);

// Re-assignment - valid
x := 20;
Print("Re-assignment of x:");
Print(x);

// Another variable - valid
let y := 30;
Print("Declaration of y:");
Print(y);

// Re-declaration of x - this should cause an error
x := 50;
Print("This line should not be executed");

// More code that won't execute due to the error
let z := x + y;
Print("Value of z: \n");
Print(z);
